## ⚙️ Challenges Faced

- Ensuring the portfolio was fully responsive across all devices required extensive testing and adjustments, especially with media queries and layout spacing.
- Aligning elements using CSS and Bootstrap was tricky at first, and I had to rework some sections multiple times to get the UI/UX right.
- I also faced challenges working with `<div>` elements — managing their positioning and nesting properly took some trial and error, but I became stronger and more confident as I figured it out.

## 🎯 Lessons Learned

- I improved my understanding of responsive design and layout structure using CSS and Bootstrap.
- I learned how to effectively use Git from the command line interface (CLI) for version control and project collaboration.
- I developed better critical thinking and problem-solving skills during the development process.
- I also became more confident using Bootstrap components and grid system to speed up my design workflow.
- Lastly, I learned how to organize and present my work clearly using GitHub README files, making my projects more professional and accessible.
